## Introduction

This code provides a simple implementation of the RRT algorithm for path planning. It consists of two files:
- `RRTbasePY.py`: Contains the RRTGraph and RRTMap classes implementing the RRT algorithm.
- `main.py`: A sample script demonstrating the usage of the RRT algorithm with a graphical representation.

## Files

1. `RRTbasePY.py`: Contains the RRTGraph and RRTMap classes implementing the RRT algorithm.

2. `main.py`: Sample script demonstrating the usage of the RRT algorithm with a graphical representation.


## Code Explanation

### RRTbasePY.py

This file (`RRT algorithm\RRTbasePY.py`) contains the implementation of the RRT algorithm. It defines two classes: `RRTMap` and `RRTGraph`.

- **RRTMap Class**: Manages the visualization of the map and obstacles. It includes methods to draw the map, obstacles, and paths.

- **RRTGraph Class**: Manages the RRT graph structure and algorithm. It includes methods for adding nodes, connecting edges, sampling the environment, and generating paths.

### main.py

This file (`RRT algorithm\RRT.py`) uses the RRT algorithm from `RRTbasePY.py` to plan a path in a 2D environment using Pygame for visualization.

- It initializes the RRTMap and RRTGraph classes.
- Obstacles and map dimensions are defined.
- The RRT algorithm is executed with visualization using Pygame.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pygame installed on your local machine.

```bash
pip install pygame

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rrt-path-planning.git
cd rrt-path-planning

python main.py
