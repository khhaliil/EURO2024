### üìÅ Repository Structure

#### 1. Data - Data and Annotations
This folder is the heart of our data collection, containing rich datasets and meticulously annotated information crucial for model training.
- **data and annotations**: Packed with datasets and corresponding YOLO annotations.
  - [Task Flower Pots v1.1](./Data/data%20and%20annotations/task_flower_potsv1.1_annot_annotations_2024_01_28_17_08_46_yolo%201.1)
  - [Task Flower Pots v1](./Data/data%20and%20annotations/task_flower_potsv1_annot-2024_01_18_18_30_23-yolo%201.1)
- **models**: Various model iterations and backups.
  - [Model V0](./Data/models/Model%20V0)
  - [Model v1 - Backup](./Data/models/Model%20v1%20-%20Backup%20before%20changes)
  - [Model v1](./Data/models/Model%20v1)
  - [Model v1.1](./Data/models/Modelv1.1)
  - [Weights](./Data/models/weights)
    -- these are the various weights ive trained , trying Nano, medium and large models.
- [Find a Missing Label Script](./Data/find%20a%20missing%20label.py)
    -- this is code for finding missing labels in the data 

#### 2. Main - Core Application Code
